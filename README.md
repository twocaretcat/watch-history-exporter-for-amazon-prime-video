## ❓ FAQ

### Nothing shows up when I paste in the console / I get a warning when I try to paste in the console
Some browsers prevent you from pasting code in the console because it could be malicious. This is called Paste Protection and you can read more about it on the [Chrome for Developers Blog].

If this happens, follow the instructions in the console to re-enable pasting, and then try again. For Chrome, the following steps should work:
 1. Try to paste something in the console. You should get a warning message about pasting
 2. Type "allow pasting" in the console and press enter

 See [this video] for a visual walkthrough.

### I get an `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier` error when running the script
Make sure that you select the entire file with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> when copying it. If part of the script is cut off, it won't work.

### The script runs, but I am not prompted to save a file
If you have a default download folder set, check if the file is there.

Otherwise, make sure "Pop-ups and redirects" and "Automatic downloads" are enabled for www.primevideo.com in your browser settings.
